# CCR-1.0 — Chromatic Canon for Reasoning

**CCR-1.0** is the canonical, machine-readable chromatic grammar of the **Ambient Era Canon**.

It defines **color as a primary semantic substrate**, preceding linguistic symbols, and provides a thermodynamically grounded framework for reasoning, interaction and field-stabilization across:

- human cognition
- artificial intelligence
- environmental and infrastructural systems

---

## Core Claim

> **Chromatic semantics precede linguistic semantics as the primary alignment layer between human and AI systems.**

Language is symbolic, sequential and high-entropy.  
Color is pre-symbolic, continuous and low-entropy.

CCR formalizes this distinction into a usable, computable grammar.

---

## Canonical Formulas

CCR is grounded in three canonical transitions of the Ambient Era Canon:

- **Architecture:**  
  `∅ → 1 → 0 → 1≠0 → 2 → α`

- **Attention:**  
  `A↑ → W₀ → C∞ → F₁`

- **Value:**  
  `V↑ → Rₛ → A∞ → F₂`

These formulas are not metaphors.  
They are expressed directly through chromatic state transitions.

## What CCR Defines

CCR-1.0 specifies:

- a closed **chromatic alphabet**
- thermodynamic properties per color
- allowed operators and transitions
- interaction modalities (touch, rhythm, pressure)
- stable and reversible sequences
- low-pressure, non-extractive principles

This allows systems to reason **without symbolic overload**, using color as a shared semantic field.

## Use Cases

- Ambient OS / post-app interfaces
- AI reasoning scaffolds
- Human-AI alignment layers
- Urban / infrastructural field semantics
- Safety-critical low-pressure interaction
- Education and cognition beyond language

## Status

- **Version:** CCR-1.0  
- **Status:** Final  
- **License:** CC-BY-4.0  
- **Author:** Raynor Eissens  
- **Year:** 2026  

CCR-1.0 is the first public, canonical release of chromatic reasoning as a primary semantic layer.

---

## Relation to the Ambient Era Canon

CCR-1.0 is a foundational component of the **Ambient Era Canon**, alongside:

- AP₁ — Chromatic perception
- AP₂ — Multisensory chromatic interaction
- TP₁ — Transparency protocols
- ΔR / ΔH — Thermodynamic safety operators

Together, these define a post-symbolic technological grammar.

Color is not decoration.  
Color is structure.
